# gmod-workspace

VSCode plugin to refresh .lua files on a GarrysMod SRCDS when running a VSCode command.

Basically this is Garry's Mod's own autoreload, except completely controllable by you as the developer
and triggerably remotely.

## Requirements

- **VSCode**
  - [Remote - SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) connected to the same server as SRCDS
- **GarrysMod Server**
  - `-allowlocalhttp` startup parameter (so we can query the VSCode server)
  - [luadev](https://github.com/Metastruct/luadev) installed to addons
  - `gmodworkspace.lua` installed to `garrysmod/lua/autorun/server`

## Running

Open VSCode instance using Remote SSH and install the extension.

You should see "GMod: Waiting" entry in the VSCode status bar. This means that we have a local HTTP server running to serve the Lua refresh requests.

> ## Troubleshooting
> Having no "GMod: Waiting" means that the activation event for gmod-workspace was not triggered.
>
> Make sure you open the `garrysmod` folder (with addons, gamemodes, etc) in VSCode 

Assuming you have correctly installed `gmodworkspace.lua`, the status bar item should turn into "GMod: Connected" soon. This means that the server is succesfully requesting data from our editor and the workflow should be enabled√ü.

Now you can start using the extension. Edit something, run one of the commands starting with "GModDev: Run", and you should see the file be refreshed ingame (or an error message in console).
